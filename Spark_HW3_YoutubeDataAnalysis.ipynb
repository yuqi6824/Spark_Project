We took him to the vet and he was put on fluids. They told us the cancer had most likely spread to his brain and he would have 2 weeks to live. We were devastated and my parents didnt want to spend money on any treatments so we took him home and were given phenobarbital for the seizures. As a last ditch effort we decided to change him onto a holistic diet. More than 2 weeks had passed and he was acting normal again but my stoner brother wanted to try CBD/THC oil to ease his pain.  That was the best decision we ever made. My dog used to have big tumors that would get punctured and bleed everywhere but we didnt want to put him through more surgeries to remove them and about 3 months after we started the oil the tumors started to shrink.  Now the only visible tumors are little ones on his tongue. I truly believe the cancer has gone into remission and Im so thankful my dog is still here and loving life. His 7th birthday is November 24th!!! I didnt think he would live as long as he has.  I definitely recommend the CBD and/or THC oil.  Going into this I did not think it would cure his cancer but it almost seems as if it has! Sorry for all of the run on sentences hahaha but Im just trying to share all this information and I really hope Shelby will make it through!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>I like to sing in front of my cat and see her reaction.......which is usually this kind of face --->  (-_-)</td></tr><tr><td>Thats a good idea letting your cats fingerpaint  or in this case pawprint on that paper and cardboard.

You have a very pretty cat. Thats a sweet name Melissa. Hope you had her spayed so she wont have any kittens. You have plenty of other cats to feed without having to take care of kittens too. Also dont encourage her to scratch your face. She could cause some damage to your eyes with her claws. It might look cute on video but it could be dangerous later on. I dont let my cats scratch my face. Thanks for doing a video of yourself with your cat.

He charged right at me and proceeded to chase my terrified German shepherd round me in circles and having his way with her.  Hes so big hes just nudging her with his face and knocking her to the ground.  POWERFUL dog.  So Im trying to get us away but also trying to stop this fucking thing from possibly impregnating my dog.  Im a big guy but physically couldnt do a god damn thing about it.  Im sure at this point my dogs probably going to get seriously hurt and Im probably going to have to fight this thing off as well.    So around 12 minutes after it first charges at us and me shouting for anyone to help. (In in the middle of nowhere)  It just stops... Lays on the floor and starts being the most incredibly friendly dog I have ever met. He was just horny.</td></tr><tr><td>I relate to this so much!! üòπ My hedgehog cocoa is just like Unhand me human!!

Ive been able to teach him the basics but have faced problems fixing his destructive behaviour and whining.Ive a tiny mix breed puppy 8 months old but he has never ending energy even though he hardly eats(he just smells food and goes away) and we play with him a lot apart from two 2 kilometre walks a day. Ive tried tiring him up everyday but still he constantly craves for attention and when he gets that he wants to scratch and bite. Moreover if you do not pay attention to him hell start whining and can go on for half and hour or so. But the most troublesome part is his destructive behaviour. When we usually go out even for 15 ministers or so he starts tearing the wallpaper the bed covers and recently the wooden bathroom doors. Not only that but when we are home and not paying attention to him he makes a meal out of our flip flops and in one case my wifes watch! Weve tried everything from buying toys to treating him to making him wear a muzzle but he somehow always manages to destroy things.The worse part about it is the fact that he is well aware of his behaviour being unacceptable. As soon as I notice his recent destruction he starts shaking in fear but never stops tearing the house. Please give me some tips and suggestions on the situation. Itll be helpful.</td></tr><tr><td>Petco trainers are mean my friend told me they told her to put pennies in a monster energy drink can and shake it to get the dogs attention they told her to get her dog on blue Buffalo it was recalled and her dog died within a week it was very sad she shouldnt have had the dog in the first place she didnt have the means to care for him the shelter threw it on her because he was gonna be put down she wanted a dog to service her but she didnt qualify for a service dog I met her through her dog my boss told me she would ban access of my service dog if I didnt train hers her dog was a boxer ridge back this dog was out of control he humped my dog in the face just a total goof but I finally did train him after seeing her try to go through pet co and seeing what they do I dont do dog food I do a raw diet for my dogs but she wasnt interested and it wasnt my dog to make her change her mind she doesnt have a animal anymore and I dont think she will ever get another after he died it was emoitional even for me his organs shut down with in a week and he died</td></tr><tr><td>If that was my cat Id surround him with cucumbers while he sleeps üòÇüòÇ</td></tr><tr><td>Im looking for a emotional support dog and I love the doberman breed.

Thank goodness it wasnt too serious. Point is even though this happened I wasnt angry with the dog. I was FURIOUS with the owner and I verbally let her have it. It is the owners who instill that aggression in their dogs and the dogs end up suffering for it.

I have been ill this past year and havent been following instagram or posting much but was wondering how Seymore was doing.  To see that you also have Sabrina is awesome. Gidget is doing great but we found out that she has a malformation in her jaw and lacks the ability to open nuts and seeds. Her physical issues require that I cut all her food small and open all her nuts and seeds. Ive found that a quick smash of a hammer breaks everything up but still requires her to work to get to the meat of the nuts and seeds. Unfortunately she is unable to be released as she now relies on me to prep her food. When my puppy found her in the yard at maybe 18 days old I committed to caring for her as long as she needed...if that means her entire life thats just fine. I dont feel wildlife should ever be caged and made into pets but sometimes they need our help. I have agreed to help rehab another orphan that a couple found in their yard and I am hoping after winter we can start the soft release process on my property. I live in an area where I can release them into the woods but also provide back-up shelter and food if they choose to stay close. Its a commitment like having a dog or cat but its so rewarding. Gidget is very domesticated now and lives a life where she is not caged 24/7 and has an entire room dedicated to her. She pretends to be a squirrel 90% of the time but she also loves to snuggle and play with her humans. The puppy that found her thinks that she is her puppy and they are very bonded to each other.  While she is super comfy with me and 2 of my dogs she is still very fearful of other humans and dogs...I have to limit my pet sitting now because it upsets her and she will hide for the duration of company visits.  Sabrina and Seymore are so lucky to have a caring human that chose to help them as opposed to euthanizing them...which was what I was told to do with Gidget. Even when the vet suggested it when he discovered why she couldnt Crack or open nuts I explained and promised her that I would care for her as long as she needed me...this spring we may allow her to spend some time in an outdoor enclosure that we will be building this winter for the new squirrel. We will revisit release options for Gidget once the threat of Winter is behind us. Unless I provide all her food and she doesnt leave the property she wont survive because she probably doesnt know how to defend herself...so...I doubt that will ever be an option for her...but she might enjoy hanging out in an enclosure where she is safe. For now Ill continue to prep her food daily and allow her to run the house and spend her time hanging out on one of her several 7ft tall cat trees and her huge 6x6x24 cage with 3 levels and swings and her pick of about 6 different nests Ive set up all over the house....can you say SPOILED SQUIRREL PRINCESS GIDGET???</td></tr><tr><td>I love border collies my dog Polly is a lab and she is not the smartest dog but she learned to sit and lay down easily</td></tr><tr><td>Maybe on your 100000 subs you should do a vlog with gohan??

Had a bush in the back yard growing up and not only did my cat rub up against it for quite a while and then take a good long nap in the tall grass but so did all the neighborhood cats as well. ¬†Where I live now I have a Honeysuckle bush in the backyard and although my two little girls Jitters and Ippy are indoor cats most of the neighborhood cats visit the bush almost on a daily basis have a ball rubbing up against it and then go find a place in the shade to relax or take a nap.¬†I bought a stuffed toy for my cats filled with Honeysuckle and whenever they get out of hand I just toss them their toys they play with them for a while and then its off to relax or sleep in one of their many places in their home.</td></tr><tr><td>#AskGTTTSD my dog will not stop barking at People that walk past do u have any tips.She was a rescue puppy if that helps love ur videos üòòüòò</td></tr><tr><td>Hey dont think what others think dont listen to people guess what i had 5 cats and 8 rats and 2 dogs not anymore now I have 2 dogs and 2 cats but one of my cats are pregnant and also I have one rabbit</td></tr><tr><td>You should of have did police noises that gets my dog to howl</td></tr><tr><td>this is what my dog does at the table</td></tr><tr><td>Myas like both of my cats combined.

My cat had really bad breath. We started with teeth cleaning and some extractions. That didnt help so blood work was done. He was in kidney failure. I lost him this February (he was 17).

The pizza cheese used at dominos has a very high lactic content and MOST (for all the my dog doesnt yadda yadda people) are lactose intolerant. The crust is okay and some of the toppings are fine just avoid onions and cheese.</td></tr><tr><td>Theres a lot of heat going on in the comments Gage! Ive gotta add my two cents if you dont mind.I have to applaud your video I think it is very educational.I agree partly with the whole Youre breaking the law by bringing a dog thats not service trained into the store Thing but I also understand why you did it and I think its important that you did.BECAUSE people should keep in mind that your dog WAS in fact acting unlike a SD in the ways you stated: He was pulling at the leash showing interest in other people and not focusing on you. He did NOT however approach other dogs or pay much attention to them and I could tell that you redirected him by not even going near other pets in the store.By the way that one VERY dedicated commenter; it is not illegal to confront someone about their SD even if you are a citizen. If you believe the animal is not acting the way a service dog must in this example a retractable leash and the dog going wherever it wanted you have every right to ask the same question anyone else can: Is that a service dog? and What services does he perform? You can ask other questions (not advised and rude) but if someone cant answer either of those two (They dont have to of course but it is illegal to LIE about it) then it prooobably isnt a service dog.I consider it my responsibility as a citizen to keep myself and ESPECIALLY those with real SDs safe in this way; it is a right.Sorry @Gage OBrien about the long winded-ness but I really appreciate your video and hope you continue to make more on educated such as these. I hope to train my dog into a real SD. :)</td></tr><tr><td>my dogs are both trying to be the alpha so my male dog buster attacked my dog Moe and he didnt let go of her eye and last time they fought my mom stuck her hand in the middle and her friend grabbed my other dog and she bit my mom and she had to get stitches</td></tr><tr><td>You are such a good dog trainer man!

Samantha has adopted her as her own kitty!- now i also feed a cat colony of household cats people threw out when they left our community! would you believe not one person will donate so much as $1 for them to be taken care of not even a can of food for them. i would like to provide shelters but right now i struggle to provide food daily for 14 cats on my disability! they come all throughout the day to eat they eat at my home all day and eat at my neighbors at night. i bring in the food at night because of raccoons and possums they fight the cats for the food and many times make them their dinner. i feed them wet and dry food where my neighbor only gives them dry. Most people say they will do the right thing but when it comes to a cat colony no one does! i also have senior cats in the colony who need the wet food more than the younger adult cats.- https://www.gofundme.com/bayhills-cat-colony</td></tr><tr><td>i allow my cats to eat off my silverware and out of bowls (they love cereal milk). my hubby gets grossed out so i have specific stuff i allow the cats to use and only i use them too. i grew up with animals eating off our stuff but he didnt.

You can train an animal without hurting them with positive reenforcement and lots of attention. Give them breaks from training or working when they need one! Ive had dogs my whole life. I dont beat my pups when they do something wrong. Ive taught them the word no. I use that when they do something they shouldnt with a very small tap on the rear end just enough so they connect the bad action with me being disappointed and never hard. Ive never shoved my dogs face in urine or anything. I successfully trained my two adult dogs who now live with my dad because hes retired and wanted something to keep him active I trained my brothers dog with him and Im training my two new pups the same as I always have-brief show of disapproval and then forgiveness. A pup their age can only know what theyre in trouble for at max about 20 minutes. Id rather positively show them not doing the specific action reaps a reward where doing the action means Im disappointed. When they do the opposite of the bad thing-they get a treat. Which backs up the I should do this because she likes when I do this enough to give me food and pets and belly rubs! Mind set. And the she DOESNT like that at all. I didnt get a treat and shes not petting me...and I was told to lay down and stay for doing that thing...maybe I shouldnt do it. Thought. Just like beating a kid doesnt really get you anything (but a case) where as showing the kid with them having a positive result in what you expect (school behavior sharing whatever youre teaching) reaps a reward. When my nieces behave well in the store with me (all under 8) they can pick out a juice or flavored water they want. But not behaving means no juices or flavored water. It only takes a warning for them to decide theyd rather behave and get something they want over misbehaving and not getting want they want.</td></tr><tr><td>my dog eat pork soup [with rice]and some chicken soup / raw [with rice]dog food only for snack :Dthats before BOTH my dog passed away</td></tr><tr><td>Vet Ranch - Just a tip I found useful with my dog: when you guys use a rope as a makeshift leash and collar also loop it around one leg to take the pressure off their necks the harder the dog pulls the tighter that rope will be around its neck hope this helps!</td></tr><tr><td>Every like for this video I will give my dog that many kisses</td></tr><tr><td>my dog will destroy anything you give her that is cloth and filled with stuffing</td></tr><tr><td>What‚Äôs the best way for me to introduce my new cat to my dog cause he already chases cats he sees in the neighborhood</td></tr><tr><td>Me with my dog everday</td></tr><tr><td>That was great to watch great footage what camera do you use and was this set up on a TriPod ?

We met Cash and it was love at 1st sight..he and I were playing and it was all good. (this shelter will not allow an adoption without a really good clear bond taking place within a hour or so...also they do a very intensive background check on adoptive parents and want references from several people as well as from your vet.) all in all a great shelter. Cash is the most amazing guy ever (Great Dane/ English Mastiff combo) hes only 11 months old but hes a fast learner and fits in well with our family. Hes still a work in progress on meeting new people ..especially men (he was abused and we are fairly certain it was by an adult male) he loves women and children and other animals..also is very protective of the whole family without being dangerous with others..he just lets them know I see you and dont know and until mom says its ok.......you arent coming any closer to us lol...which is what I wanted. (we live in a decent sized city ... and I wanted a buddy but I also wanted a dog that would be able to not only sound a alarm but to protect if need be.......without being so aggressive that he would be a danger to have....I have a amazing dog and I would suggest to anyone out there looking for a great dog......puppies are great....but young dogs and adult dogs can be amazing as well ... give them a chance and usually you wont be disappointed if you have done your homework on the mix or full blood breed and ask questions about their quirks and behavior..they are just like us.....they dont like certain things people ...smell...actions...if YOU do it ... it will be a positive experience for everyone and a homeless dog or puppy will have a chance at a great loving home.</td></tr><tr><td>i had a baby pit bull girl but we moved to Germany and pit bulls arent alowed so we had to gave her away and when we go back home from 3 years apart we will see her again(When she was in the home in isa she traded up everything because she missed us and they gave her to an army person and know shes a army dog)i hope one day ill see her</td></tr><tr><td>I finally know what my dog is now Its a labskyüòçüòçüòç</td></tr><tr><td>Obeliksdont fucking choke that dogthis is a shame when i compare all my dogs and thisgo grab some chicken wings</td></tr><tr><td>One of my cat hates me and one of my cat loves me lol</td></tr><tr><td>I think you are a good trainer Gage and you have very valid points. The work you are doing about animal abuse that some people describe as training is second to none. I would ask thought that you find another phrase besides balanced trainers because not all trainers who use some sort of negative reinforcement fall into the category that you created when you show ABUSIVE TRAINERS. I personally do not use compulsion to train my dogs but I have in a setting that does not qualify as training. Just to be clear I rarely but occasionally correct my dog in everyday life when my training with them is not complete or if I know that they know what Im talking about but are testing boundaries. After all they are living creatures with brains so they will occasionally test boundaries. And again just to clarify I DONT HIT OR CAUSE ANY SERIOUS PAIN. I only use to get the attention of the dog. I hope I explained myself good enough that you dont believe me ABUSIVE</td></tr><tr><td>#askGTTSD hey Jessica I have a few questions 1. Can dogs get homesick? 2.

I felt so horrible for him during all the surgery and the issues. I do hope the other dog owners at least help out with some of the bills. I would had I ever been in that situation. Makes me glad my dog has never been small animal aggressive. The neighbors white bunny would get loose and even come in my fenced yard through gaps in the gate. My dog never hurt her. I have been adopted recently by a stray cat and she walks anywhere she wants in the yard - even right past my dog - and my dog doesnt react at all. She is more afraid of this stray orange cat that keeps coming around than she is of my dog. - Heidi</td></tr><tr><td>Thats so sweet and reminded me of my cat Sam (I Am) who also looked after kittens and would groom them yet he was male. He was so very gentle and loved everything.

I got my dogs from rescue and only paid $150.</td></tr><tr><td>i dont think the yowl sound means mating/I dont want you here.a year before my cat passed away she startes making the yowling sounds out of nowhere.. always when it was evening and me and my family got upstairs and she was alone in the living room(she wasnt allowed upstairs.) she also made that sound when she thought when she was alone.she was 18 and did that every day till she passed away when she was 19..does anyone know what the reason was? the only thing I can think of was being alone/and elder thinf</td></tr><tr><td>my two dogs are not dogs there family members who have been my dogs for years and years</td></tr><tr><td>my dogs are not dogs there family</td></tr><tr><td>These like my dog are people reincarnated as dogs.</td></tr><tr><td>Love his vids my dog learns within a couple days..the adds well a little less would be nice</td></tr><tr><td>I started crying and went to go hug my dogs.

This is so hard. I am one to day that a pet is forever But I too have had to rehome my dog I got him when I was young and was not ready. I needed to move and could not find anywhere to take him and instead of being homeless I gave him up to more into an apartment. I also understand because I have depression and some days it is really hard to get up and take care of my guinea pigs.</td></tr><tr><td>it has the opposite affect of sedation for my cat she seems stoned on a daily basis and cat nip makes her twacked out and she goes ape  shit</td></tr><tr><td>luckily my dog is alpha as fuck every dog except one that has ran up to him change their mind about attacking him the one that tried I was able to separate them</td></tr><tr><td>the second cat looks exactly like my cat!</td></tr><tr><td>my cats are not allowed on the counter but do it any way!</td></tr><tr><td>I would have killed the pitbulls if they attacked my dogs.</td></tr><tr><td>I smell my cats too üòÇ</td></tr><tr><td>when I tried this to my dog he tried to eat the camera</td></tr><tr><td>#fanfriday :Where I live its really hot and my husky hates water and refuses to stay inside how do I keep her cool during the day?Please help Im a first time Husky owner and I dont want anything to happen to my dog</td></tr><tr><td>I think imma freak out if my cat talks to us like that in real life üòÇ</td></tr><tr><td>I wonder what gohan would do if you pretended to die my dog would just sit on my face v.v</td></tr><tr><td>my cat broke her leg and we cant afford the surgery. what should I do?</td></tr><tr><td>If i exercise my dogs a lot then I dont have to worry about them when Im away!</td></tr><tr><td>So cool!

Nice pool too. I am struggling with my pup to play in the kiddie pool any tips? I think I will go in the pool instead of the dog-lol</td></tr><tr><td>I like your smaller more frequent segments it is more interesting with the breaks the reason is too often human over train only one aspect of exercise and this allows for creativity on the behalf the dog and human. Your videos have inspired me and my pup to combine activities and training and it seems to just fall into place. Keep sharing.</td></tr><tr><td>Coconut oil and castor oil saved my dogs we had a dog with the same issue and more and within a couple of months and a raw diet we had a new dog. She died at age 16 with all of her hair and her teeth. We made one huge mistake with our puppy and that was not getting the blood work prior to vaccines turns out she had lyme disease. So blood work first good health and then one vaccine at a time. We learned the hard way. You just can not tell by a regular check up. Although this is not holistic it works like a charm for skin issues https://www.dollartree.com/Supreme-Healthy-Max-Skin-Coat-Dog-Treats-4-oz-Bags/p305043/index.pro and just $1. Keep up the nice work and hoping things always get better. Blessings.</td></tr><tr><td>Hey I took your advise and got the same pool-lol it took more than a month but my pup will go in the pool and dig out her frisbee and drink in. She is just starting the dig routine. Perhaps before Indian summer is over she may get it. I loved all of your dogs having fun and especially got a kick out of Twix flicking up his tail-nice work.Tx.</td></tr><tr><td>Just a curious question I have been re-evaluating my dogs food and have introduced some collagen for us and them have you ever tried that and if so did you notice any difference if so what? Tx.</td></tr><tr><td>I wish my pup is so crazy these days I have to short leash her to visit grandma so she does not knock her down also grandma has no idea how to interact with her. It takes time for my dog to absorb the new environment if I took her back home she would never go anywhere. She is better but she is a slow dog because she is like too smart and wants to do too much so we have to hold her back.</td></tr><tr><td>Wow you and Twix have done such an amazing job I think I will start using these tips for my legs along with my dog. Twixs strides look so nice the slow-mo really helps to show the details on such a quick breed. That said any tips on active play for aussie/border puppies about 9 month without over doing it? I find it hard to reign mine in. Blessings.</td></tr><tr><td>Neat how long does he walk for as I am unfamiliar with this. Such an improvement good job Twix! Oh I got my pup to play with the ball in and out of the pool along with the frisbee but she cheats she only goes in as far as she can to just snatch the toy out. I do praise her greatly but I think she thinks it is for be a smarty pants and outwitting me. LOL</td></tr><tr><td>He looks amazing Pam you are both quite the team. I have to start video tapping my puppy more to keep better track of things think I will steal my ds igo camera-lol it just sits in a box anyway. Continued success! Blessings!</td></tr><tr><td>Your videos have made me realize with my puppy for service work that I need to train her on both sides to keep her even and on top of things too. I find since I am ambidextrous that helps my own p/t when I work with her it then works for me.  I just have to learn how to video.  Keep sharing.</td></tr><tr><td>I have to laugh my dog at 12 weeks was better than now at 8 months. Hope I live through it lol Great points why does it get harder with time? Or is it that they are just learning more and they regress a little to figure it out?</td></tr><tr><td>Distractions cause my dog to have to warm up for 15 minutes take a break in the car for 10 minutes and then try again for a few minutes. She has regressed a lot and is done teething so it gets so depressing.</td></tr><tr><td>you have described my dog she is an Aussie/Border leans more border but working on service with me how long does it take for your dogs to mature to a well trained pup? I heard 2 years so I was wondering this.</td></tr><tr><td>Nice explanation totally what I do with my pups over the years. Now the challenge Aussie Shepherd Border Collie Cross with lots of butterflies in the brain-lol yeah love the mix breeds and crosses they are all good though.</td></tr><tr><td>I am so sorry Stacy! I can understand the stress you wee going through about a year ago my cat (17 years old) had nose cancer on her nose. The veterinarians were able to cut off the section of her nose that contained the cancer. they also had to pull two of her teeth. She still lives happily now I hope the best for Pages recovery!</td></tr><tr><td>finally one of these videos without american (terrorists) soldiers. these videos makes me miss my dog even more...</td></tr><tr><td>that skunk is EXACTLY LIKE my dog!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>You‚Äôre a good owner brother.. on my channel which I have 5 million views you can see my pups as well.. be proud of the way you treat him man.. not many owners treat there dogs this good</td></tr><tr><td>Is your kitty good with your hamsters or did you have to keep a good grip on Mochi?

The bearded dragons are a very calm lizard. Have had to rescue some from my dogs and such. They usually dont run until you touch them and they calm down pretty quick. Probably why many reptile keepers find them great pets.</td></tr><tr><td>Dude my dog has been missing for 4-5 year :L No fair ;(</td></tr><tr><td>So why is my dog banned.. apparently because its a thugs dog they took my babies years ago and after a decade theyre still banned.. its ok though just got a blue bully and every time we see the doggy police we run like hell yelling bully lifes matter bark life...</td></tr><tr><td>Love watching the live streams and seeing Ari looks like my cat I had for 3 yrs and miss.</td></tr><tr><td>Im so sorry for Page!!! 2 weeks ago my cat ate a ribbon and she had to get it removed from her stomach.

I found my dog as a lost puppy after a storm in Texas and she became my steady companion .  We  lived in Germany and Mexico and everywhere we went  she would just look at me and all I decided to do with her was OK. We have had 10 adventurous years together.So glad you found the puppies.  They could have been dinner for a coyote family.</td></tr><tr><td>I have an owl with a hurt eye that my dogs found. Do you want it?</td></tr><tr><td>Ive had a situation where my dog was not welcome with me so I left with him and Ive found many situations where there are people dont respect the importance of pets (particularly when renting a home) ... no matter the cost to my circumstances I couldnt live with the unhappiness of betraying a pet. ¬†I hope the new owners of this sweet pet consider contacting this girl and allow her to visit. ¬†Pet sharing could be an answer? ¬†.. and yes karma to that man .. energetically of course you get reflected back to you what you put out .. thats the neutrality of the Universe</td></tr><tr><td>Two of my cats are huge cantaloupe melon lovers.</td></tr><tr><td>my cat had that</td></tr><tr><td>my cat had this but the vet just cut the top layer of skin</td></tr><tr><td>Ill tell my dog Im cold and she lays on my feet</td></tr><tr><td>hi my dog just died and here is proof from my sisters video its called:(Rest in peace my baby.) by (Evelyn castellanos) make sure you put a dot (.) after Rest in peace my baby üíîüò≠</td></tr><tr><td>I can never watch full stories like these  make me cry to see the nasty human beings we have in this world .

Keep up with the good work xx</td></tr><tr><td>Thank you for teaching me something new about my cats. I foster mother cats and kittens as well so it helps me to be able to teach others about it.

The reason my puppy is so well trained is because of your videos! My fiancee and I go straight to your videos when we have a training problem with our pup Naga. One thing we cant seem to figure out is how to get him to lay down without luring him. He only lays down if we lure him with a treat. I can get him to stay for 20 seconds once hes down. He just wont laydown unless lured! Would love a video on in depth lay down training. Thanks XOXO love you and what youre doing!!</td></tr><tr><td>I laughed when he brought out the bat.

Her name is Screech bc when she was found in an abandoned building her meows sounded like bad breaks on a car.  So I kept her name.  I noticed when I brought her home she was more dog like she would fetch plays nonstop always sleeps on her back  with paws up .  Her tail is bent / crooked and loves people .  I later discovered  she is a Domestic tabby Bobcat Short tail.  Right away I knew there was something else  I was over looking  but didnt know what ? Until I brought her to the vet for shots spade ect... Her meows are so cute...but very whinny  (screeching sound) .   She is so sweet lovable and loves to have her belly rubbed.

She was very brave <3 Bye -Mangle</td></tr><tr><td>1:02 My face when I realize Im supposed to be brushing my cats teeth from now on</td></tr><tr><td>Its not working for my dog</td></tr><tr><td>my cat was terrified when we adopted him.  he is now 1-2 years old and was feral about four or five months ago. now hes amazing and so kind</td></tr><tr><td>Its ok if you cry every one crys I cryed when my cat died at lest that there in a better place</td></tr><tr><td>hi larry my dog is scare of cars noise while were walking any idea wat can i do.</td></tr><tr><td>Im so making these!

Imma get my puppy a good ol petting rn</td></tr><tr><td>Its apparent that you have an abundant amount of patience and youve painstakingly adopted your lives around an amazing dog. As I watched your video I laughed because my sisters dog Bella a Labradoodle has some of the behaviors of your special girl Brante. Bella wants to play all the time and she will swim in the pool for hours fetching and returning frisbees and balls. Its odd for me to encounter a dog who looks like a poodle behave more like a working dog such as the Lab that is inside her. Mals are beautiful and purposeful and youve made a perfect video demonstrating the pros and cons of owning such a majestic breed. I would have made the same mistakes in training as you had made because I would just want to hug her too! I hug all my dogs because as you said I love them.I recently lost Mia my precious German Shepherd I rescued 11 years ago. She had the uncanny determination powerful will and heightened intelligence of your Brante. There were a myriad amount of fascinating attributes that I discovered about Mia. However during her explosive bouts of play she was very gentle with me. Giving her the football or pointedly feeding her a snack from my hand she was very mindful that my hand being close to her mouth and gently took the food without ever biting my fingers. She knew the difference between the food and my hand. Sometimes She would allow me to drop the food into her mouth. When you spoke about losing your dog of 15 years I understand how you feel. It is abundantly clear that you are a kindred spirit. Thank you for making this video and if she will allow please give Brante a hug from me. üêïüêæüíï</td></tr><tr><td>I got my dog that same toy awhile ago she never took squirrels out not really but she did basically destroy the house  the sides of it she made holes and stuffing is coming out everywhere and plays with everything separately but the squirrels she loves they are still one with no holes but the house well yeah</td></tr><tr><td>my dog is gone</td></tr><tr><td>Yesterday my cat broke my favorite vase. naughty little turd</td></tr><tr><td>I should probably make these for my dogs but would it be ok if I do not use food colouring</td></tr><tr><td>im going to do this with my doggo‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</td></tr><tr><td>These people dont deserve this kitty.

Is this recipe a 60 day supply? my only worry is I have a small freezer and if I buy packs of liver & heart to mix in with chicken & chicken wings I wont have room to freeze or end up with waste by throwing it out. Also what heart & liver do you use does it have to be chicken. Where I live there are no local butchers for miles so most will have to be bought from a supermarket nor can my budget stretch to organic. Also do you add all the egg to the food as I read you are only meant to add yolk? Also I cant afford a grinder so is it safe to cut larger bones up or just use a mallet ?   I prefer the idea of not using supplements except Taurine and if so how much if I cant get hearts ......Thank you</td></tr><tr><td>My rabbit thinks my cat is his best friend.

As an experienced cat owner they only live around 14 to 15 years. At least all my cats i have had have only lived that long. Anyway you should not blame yourself for this even if you where to take him from the shelter it wouldnt have made to much of a difference you cant fight age or death so please stacy dont blame yourself. honestly you are the most capable person of taking care of a animal so just dont beat yourself up on it.

(if you dont know they wrap around the dogs body and if the dog pulls it squeezes them around their body)/ Not necessarily on using them as a training tool but just to alleviate the pressure on my dogs neck when he pulls. Obviously we are still working on pulling with training; however in the mean time I just feel so bad for him when he pulls the leash so hard on his neck.

I think you can never have too many pets as long as they are cared for proporly and payed attention to. You do an amazing job taking care of all of your pets and I think that you should get more.  2. I think that certain people are born with the animal lover trait. I have been absoulutly obsessed with animals all my life (so far im only 11).  3. I have a dog a hamster and a bearded dragon. I had another dog but it recently passed away. I personaly want to breed reptiles and see all the amazing personalitys colors and patterns.Im not alowed to though because my parents wont let me.  4. Love the merch.

Plus my dogs would definitely love it</td></tr><tr><td>hahaha! so funny my dog is hungry let me record it! hahaha üòë</td></tr><tr><td>My partner and i live in a high rise apartment building. the first thing we ever talked about in the apartment is making sure the cats carriers are easy to grab and our cats know the minute we grab them and put them on the floor they run over and climb in. we trained that into them so if there is ever a fire or emergency they will climb right in and feel safe. Both of my cats are also chipped and are always updated. my cats are my children and i am always concerned with their safety before my own.</td></tr><tr><td>Thanks for sharing your experience. I am nervous on having my dog go under anesthesia only because she is 9 years old never had a dental cleaning. I will ask my vet if she needs it now because she only has plaque on the top back mullers.  I do brush her teeth but not regularly and she gets dental chews.</td></tr><tr><td>thank you so so so much for the pooper scooper review. I really need to get one not so much for my dogs but for my new pet goats.</td></tr><tr><td>After we moved to a new house away from the stadium where a lot of fireworks happened; one of my dogs who never cared about fireworks started freaking out. 4th of July was not as bad this year because the dogs got desensitized since neighborhood kids have been playing with fireworks since May. They still reacted a little bit to the loud ones but it wasnt too bad. Lavender oil helps to calm dogs down and cotton balls inside their ears to help with the loud sounds. You could try hemp (CBD¬†oil) dog treats if its legal in your state it really helps out my anxious old dog.  Hopefully this helps.</td></tr><tr><td>You could wash the potty pads with vinegar to disinfect and baking soda to remove stains. I might get a couple since my dog has been having accidents in the house when I am not home. Great review.</td></tr><tr><td>In all honesty i dont even like giving that to my dog yet to my reptiles i feed my dog real food because even if it says its safe i dont take risks my rabbits eat real fruits vegtables and my reptiles eat vetgtable meat fruit or bugs like critkets depending on what it is  nice video keep up the great work</td></tr><tr><td>If I went away and came back my dog would be like ‚Äújust dropping in are ya be gone within the next few days ok‚Äù</td></tr><tr><td>guys my dog (1 yr chocolate lab) is throwing up having diarrhea and wont eat.been like this the whole day.

I went for the ones with out the painted shells cause it freaked me out cause I thought that the paint was bad(obvi) I thought they didnt like the taste (like licking nail polish before its fully cured... I was 10. Dont judge) so I got two plain shelled hermit crabs as a gift from my great grandparents. My grandparents then took me to the pet store to get them a big tank and some recommended stuff. They had the cuddle fish bones we had meal worms a basking spot and I had to mist them 2-3 times a day depending (my mom misted them while I was at school) they lived about 3 years. I was pretty proud of little me. Till my dog traumatized them knocking them over and their water dishes falling on top of them. The worst was when they were switching shells. They looked so creepy. First time I thought they were dead and my mom had to google what was up because I was in a panic attack. They were my babies. They let me hold them. They never pinched me. I got lucky. 13 year old me was devastated when they died. It was also my first year of middle school so life was already sucky and my hermit crabs dying was the icing on the cake that year üòÇüòÇüòÇ</td></tr><tr><td>this cat looks exactly like my cat!</td></tr><tr><td>I Totally miss my dogüò¢</td></tr><tr><td>Ive had my dog for almost 6 years he was about a year old when I found him and had been mistreated.¬† he has scars on his face and back.¬† The vet thinks he was beat with something like a cord or rod or he was used as bait dog.¬† Anyway he still gets scares and yelps when my husband raises his voice even if he and I are fussing at each other or if hes fussing about a football game.¬† people who abuse dogs kids or elderly people need to be put out of our misery.</td></tr><tr><td>lol if the dog lives at the venue (or at least spends a lot of days there) this would be a regular occurrence.

This video was so interesting it was also interesting to see how you reacted when things went wrong. Thats always the hardest part for me I dont have birds but I do get frustrated easily when something goes wrong and Im trying to work on that while raising my dog. Ive watched your videos for a long time and Ive watched all your old content almost twice and I am so happy to see more content popping onto your channel and to see how life has changed and how it keeps changing and how you adjust to those changes. Its all great stuff and I cant wait to start my own journey in this.Completely off topic but have you ever worked with a Hyacinth Macaw or know media pages or youtubers I could find who may have one. Im very interested in this specific parrot but its so hard to learn more about these gentle giants they seem to be quite rare even among avid macaw groups. Would love to see any stories or content if you have encountered a hyacinth and if not then all the more macaw content for me!</td></tr><tr><td>Lol my dog would love this thing</td></tr><tr><td>It‚Äôs hard to imagine giving away or abandoning my dogs!

I have to pay attention so my dog and I are not jerks on the trail but it gives her the length to go sniff stuff while I can reel her in as needed. I had the round parachute cord-type leads but replaced it with the flat webbing tape because I did get a few friction burns from having to grab the line to gain control quickly. I also live in an environment where wearing gloves about 6 months of the year so I am less exposed to the line anyway.</td></tr><tr><td>hey stacy Im really glad she only got you eyelid and not your actual eye Ill pray that your eye will heal and not get infected . all of my dogs and cats are rescues and Im happy I found them  and your channel</td></tr><tr><td>koho is so  self assured  he owns all that he sees lol as far as the weening to soon you can get a fussy blanky for the kitten.

Aah so nice you took all that cat food to the shelter!! Aah so many nice dogs without a loving home :(.</td></tr><tr><td>With what you said at the start of the video of how youre not meant to break up a dog fight usually when my dogs fight we dont try to break it up because usually its over in a couple of seconds without injury but if the fight is lasting longer than normal then we will try to stop it. But one time when I went camping with my family and my dogs one of my dogs and my cousins dog got into a fight they have had little scraps before and nobody got hurt so we thought it would be fine until my cousins dog (who is a german shepherd) picked up my dog (who is a jack russel) by the waist and started shaking him around literally trying to kill him. Thankfully my dog is still alive. He had to get surgery and got stitches and drips for a month or so but hes fine now. But thats the difficult thing about dogs fighting because you dont know how intense its going to be and if you should try to break it up or not and yes I know that my cousins dog is about 4 times bigger than mine but as I said before theyve had fights and play fights before and everyone was fine plus my cousins dog is only a puppy and had had most of her teeth knocked out by a horse kick to the face so we didnt think it would be that intense. But yeah its really hard to know if you should let the fight play out and let the dogs figure it out or if you should try to stop it.</td></tr><tr><td>Aww i wish my puppy would do this kind of suff üòç</td></tr><tr><td>lol my dog wins in begging for food too my mom gave him a steak and said  shhh dont tell your mommy XDD</td></tr><tr><td>at my petsmart they have an adoption organization for cats i got my cat and shes a happy little chubby sweetheart.</td></tr><tr><td>1:56 and 5:24 Im dying of laughter X3Edited:Even my cat is confused whats happening</td></tr><tr><td>Why the hell would they leave there dogs to die?

Hes the biggest love nut but he hates men. He only likes about three. Other wise he will growl and bark. If they tried to touch him he would snap. We didnt know this until a while ago when he did snap at a friend of ours. I love him so much but like you said this is what you sign up for. I will forever only rescue my pets even if they have some issues. They need homes just as much as dogs from breeder if not more. So many cats and dogs die a year because there isnt enough room in shelter. I love how Stacy is a famous youtube but still has a loving heart to rescue all her pets. I love my rescued cat and dog even if they may be different.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":36},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["According to the comments of the cat and dog owners, they are mainly interested in the topics about:\n\n1) The interesting behaviors of cats and dogs\n\n2) The diseases that can contract their pets\n\n3) The friendly act done by human to cats and dogs"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### 4.

Analysis and Future work"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##### 1) overview of project \nThis project mainly focus on identifying the owners of cats and dogs from all users by their comments. After that, I do some research on the toptics and creators that attract them.\n\n##### 2) data clean and analysis\nThere are several important points of the data processing in this project. Firstly, I need to define the identification to extract the label from comments. Then, I need to apply word2Vec method here to convert their comments to features. Finally, I need to do the down-sampling on the label 0 because this dataset is very unbalanced and the models I apply are all supervised learning models which are sensitive to unbalanced data.\n\n##### 3) build ml model\nFor all the models applied in this project, I create cross-validation to find the optimal hyper-parameters for them. And the metric I used in this project is AUC score since this metric can show the performance of models on various aspects.\n\n##### 4) recommendation based on the model results\nBased on the result of this project, I advise the creators who want to attract more owners should pay attention to their name. They should make a name that is relative to dogs and cats. What's more, I also find out that owners of dogs and cats are very attractive by the famous pets on the internet."],"metadata":{}}],"metadata":{"name":"Spark HW3 Youtube data analysis","notebookId":1976858028761214},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
